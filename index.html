        <ul class="timelineInfo">
          <h2 class="Heading">ORIGIN</h2>
            <h3 class="card-subhead">Name Wu-Tang originates from the martial arts film, Shaolin and Wu Tang, where warriors were trained to fight in the Wu Tang kung fu style</h3>
            <h3 class="card-subhead">Group originally composed of RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa</h3>
          
          <h2 class="Heading">FOUNDING</h2>
            <p> Late 1980s: Cousins robert diggs (Prince Rakeem/The scientist), gary grice (the genius), and russell jones (the specialist) formed a group named force of the imperial master, also known as the all in together now crew.</p>
            <p>The group never signed to a  major label, but caught the attention of the NY city rap scene and was recognized by rapper Biz Markie.</p>

            <p>1991: Genius and Prince Rakeem signed to separate record labels where both were eventually dropped by their labels. Group refocused efforts and on new monikers; Genius became GZA "Jizza," Prince Rakeem became RZA "Rizza."</p>
            <p>After collaborating with some artists such as Dennis Coles, later known as Ghostface Killah and another rapper from Stapleton Houses in Staten Island, the duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of Eastern philosophy picked up from kung fu movies, Five Percent Nation teachings picked up on the NY streets, and comic books.</p>

            <p>1992: Wu Tang Clan assembled, with RZA as the de facto leader and the group's producer. Name was adopted after the film Shaolin and Wu Tang.</p>
          
          <h2 class="Heading">START OF FAME</h2>
            <p>1993: Wu-Tang Clan released their independent single "Protect Ya Neck," resulting in the start of their fame through a sizable underground following.</p>
            <p>Loud/RCA record agrees to sign the group, releasing their debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) in November, which to date is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.</p>
            <p>Due to the group's creative and influential force, this allowed the group members to negotiate solo contracts while their group was signed to a label.</p>

          <h2 class="Heading">SOLO ALBUMS</h2>
            <p>1994: Method Man's (RZA) debut album, Tical, was released in November (1st member to release a solo project).</p>

            <p>1995: Raekwon's debut studio album, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., was released in August. GZA's debut album, Liquid Swords, was released in November.</p>

            <p>1996: Ghostface Killah released his first solo album, Ironman, in October.</p>
            <p>Although the albums were released as solo, RZA's presence behind the production, and the large number of guest appearances from other Wu-Tang Clan members has rendered them to be mostly all-round group efforts.</p>
          
          <h2 class="Heading">GRAMMY NOMINATED</h2>
            <p>1997: Wu-Tang Clan reassembled to release the Grammy-nominated multiplatinum double album Wu-Tang Forever, which debuted at number one on the Billboard Charts. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album has sold over 8.3 million copies to date worldwide.</p>
          
          <h2 class="Heading">DIVERSIFICATION</h2>
            <p>1998: After the release of Wu-Tang Forever, the empire shifted its focus to promoting emerging affiliated artists. The album Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm (a compilation album) showcased Wu-affiliated artists, including new solo tracks from the original group members. The Swarm certified gold.</P>
          
            <p>1998-2000: In the space of two years, the second round of solo albums from Wu-Tang saw second efforts from the five members who had already released albums, as well as debuts from all the remaining members with the exception of Masta Killa (seven of them being released in the space of seven months between June 1999 and January 2000).</p>
          
          <h2 class="Heading">THE W AND IRON FLAG</h2>
            <P>2000: The group released “The W,” which went double platinum. The album was recorded while Ol’ Dirty Bastard was incarcerated, and so his vocals recorded over the inmate telephones.</p>
          
            <p>2001: Wu-Tang Clan released Iron Flag, of which made use of outside producers and guests, including Ron Isley, Flavor Flav, and Trackmasters. Method Man began his acting career along with close collaborator Redman</p>
          
          <h2 class="Heading">ISSUES, DEATH, DOCUMENTARY</h2>
            <P>2003: Ol’ Dirty Bastard was released from incarceration and immediately signed with Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella Records on the same day that he was released.</P>
          
            <P>2004: U-God left the group, later releasing a DVD titled "Rise of a Fallen Soldier" detailing his frustrations with being in the group (mainly issues with his treatment from RZA). He then formed his own group with some young protegés, called the Hillside Scramblers, with whom he released an album. During a phone conversation on live radio, U-God and RZA had a heated dispute which ultimately led to the two reconciling and U-God returning to the group.</p>
            <p>The Wu-Tang Clan also unexpectedly returned to the live stage, going on a European tour before coming together as a full group to headline at the Rock the Bells festival in California. The concert was released on CD as Disciples of the 36 Chambers: Chapter 1, and the Clan also released a music-video greatest hits album: Legend of the Wu-Tang Clan.</p>
            <p>On November 13, Ol' Dirty Bastard collapsed in the Wu-Tang's recording studio and was pronounced dead later that night. Wu-Tang paid him homage a number of times: in August 2006, one of his sons came out at a Wu-Tang concert at Webster Hall and rapped "Brooklyn Zoo", along with his mother, and during a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom the Clan brought his mother out on stage for a sing-along to "Shimmy Shimmy Ya".</p>
          
            <p>2005: RZA released his first book: The Wu-Tang Manual, and the release of U-God’s second album, Mr. Xcitement. GZA and producer DJ Muggs and Grandmasters also held a long-awaited collaboration.</p>
            <p>The documentary, U-God: Rise of a Fallen Soldier, was released. It portrayed U-God’s side of the struggle between him and RZA.</p>

Wu-Tang Clan released their fifth full-length group album, 8 Diagrams, on Steve Rifkind’s SRC Records, of which marked the inclusion of Cappadonna as an official member of the group. 8 Diagrams received mixed views, causing Raekwon and Ghostface Killah to propose recording a group album (Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang) without RZA production. The album would become Raekwon’s fifth solo album.</p>
          
            <p>2008: RZA released Digi Snacks to primarily introduce group affiliates, such as Freemurder, Killa Sin, Black Knights. GZA released his Pro Tools album.</p>
